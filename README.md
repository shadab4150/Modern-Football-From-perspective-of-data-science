# Modern Football From perspective of data science
>I combined my love for football and data science to create exploratory analysis of the football  dataset found on kaggle using Python.
>The dataset on kaggle is organized in 3 files:

>>events.csv contains event data about each game. Text commentary was scraped from: bbc.com, espn.com and onefootball.com
>>ginf.csv - contains metadata and market odds about each game. odds were collected from oddsportal.com
>>dictionary.txt contains a dictionary with the textual description of each categorical variable coded with integers

>I have used this data to:

>>Make visualizations about  games played.
>>Build expected goals models and compare players on various attributes.
