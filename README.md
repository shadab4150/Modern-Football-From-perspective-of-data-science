# Modern Football From perspective of data science
* I have combined my love for football and data science to create exploratory analysis of the football  dataset found on kaggle using Python.
* The dataset on kaggle is organized in 3 files:

* **events.csv** contains event data about each game. Text commentary was scraped from: bbc.com, espn.com and onefootball.com
* **ginf.csv** - contains metadata and market odds about each game. odds were collected from oddsportal.com
* **dictionary.txt** contains a dictionary with the textual description of each categorical variable coded with integers

* I have used this data to:

* Make **Explorative Data Analysis** about  games played.
